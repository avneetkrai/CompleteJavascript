# __Variables and Data Types in Javascript__

## Variables
Variables are used to store some data or information.

------------------------------------------------
examples: 1. var name = "Avneet" 
            --Value "Avneet" is assigned to Variable named "name"
           
          2. var i = 20; // Number
            --Value "20" is assigned to Variable named "i"
------------------------------------------------

Javascript checks the value assigned to variable and identifies its type.


## Data Types
Javascript is dynamically typed language as the variable type is identified at run-time.

Javascript allows to change the type of variable during the program execution.


## Rules for choosing variable names

- Spaces are not allowed in variable names.
- Only letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs are permitted in variable names.
- Case matters when it comes to variable names. 'Name' and 'name' are two different identifiers.
- A letter (alphabet), an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($) must be the first character in a variable name, any other special characters must not be taken.
- Reserved words in javascript shouldnâ€™t be used to name variables. e.g.  public, return are not valid variable names.

## typeof Operator

The typeof is an operator keyword which is used to get a type at the compile-time.
